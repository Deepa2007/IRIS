# Iris Flower Classification
This project uses machine learning to classify Iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset includes the following features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The goal is to build a classifier that can predict the species of Iris flowers based on these features.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

# Setup
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Iris-Flower-Classification.git
cd Iris-Flower-Classification

#Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script to train the model:
python src/train_model.py

# Results
The model classifies Iris flowers into three species with high accuracy (98% on average).
Visualizations of feature importance and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) are generated.
